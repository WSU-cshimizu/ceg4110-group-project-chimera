## Pertinent Questions

* Question 1: What kind of notes and documentation do you write?
    * Answer: Procedures, guides, documentation, etc. People should be able to pick up where you left off. Keeps a dev log for personal notes because stuff often comes up again.
* Question 2: What does your typical day look like?
    * Answer: I pick up where I left off yesterday, attend any meetings, perform sysadmin tasks, etc.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. You don't need to learn it all.

There's too much. Work to learn as much as you can but understand there will always be something new when learning to be a SE. 

### 2. No company is the same and no team is the same.


### 3. Don't be afraid to job hop early on:
- small vs large companies
- single widget shop vs multi widget shop
- startups vs well-established
- private sector vs gov
- non-profit vs for-profit
- freelancing


### 4. Try to learn forever skills:
- linux
- http
- bash
- tcp/ip
- sql


### 5. His wife doesn't like when he only has a moustache.

He is required to keep both the beard and moustache. (He also said that he would like this in the notes.)

### 6. Don't reinvent the wheel

Take things off the shelf as much as possible and reuse old code.
